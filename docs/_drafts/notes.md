* Some older ones have a 0.01% slope on small segments
* change the length limit to 400ft
* when there's a significant slope change
* identify slope error's before running H&H tools
* possible map with boundary's of runoff coefficients
    * map of what is in those files
    * hard copy studies are probabky not a focus now because they are recent ish

* label expression is a bit confusing, maybe embed code in the SOP

Sue to run new PDFs for al old ones
